//! `fusor-cost` — one scalar picosecond roofline parameterized on *measured*
//! device facts, and the one extraction that resolves node selection,
//! materialization and schedule point together against it.
//!
//! Not a lexicographic tuple: the reference's own unit test shows the tuple
//! gives the wrong verdict, and its own doc concedes dispatches are 0.2% of
//! modelled time while the tuple will pay unbounded bandwidth to remove one.
//!
//! Precision is **not** a cost term — it is a verifier property
//! (`NumericContract`), because a time-only model eliminates f32 everywhere.
