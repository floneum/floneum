//! TUPLE — two reduction nests over the same iteration space and the same
//! reduction axis are ONE nest over the concatenated carrier.
//!
//! ```text
//! < Fold{C1, a, ops1}, Fold{C2, a, ops2} >
//!   ==  slot views of  Fold{ C1 (x) C2, a, ops1 u ops2 }
//! ```
//!
//! `(x)` is [`Carrier::tuple`], whose slot deduplication happens inside the
//! constructor, so joining `(m,l)` with `(m,o)` yields three slots and not
//! four by construction.
//!
//! Exactly value-preserving: every slot folds in precisely the order it folded
//! alone, so this law needs no `reassoc` guard and is legal on an f16
//! accumulator and under [`NumericContract::STRICT`].
//!
//! Rooting is consumer-rooted: the rule fires at a node that already reads
//! both nests.
//!
//! * [`TUPLE`] roots at a `Map` consumer.
//! * [`TUPLE_SIBLING`] roots at a `Fold` consumer — a reducing nest that
//!   itself reads two reducing nests.
//!
//! Acyclicity: neither nest's operand closure may transitively reach the
//! other's result, checked through `Op::Union` chains as well as `children`,
//! because the acyclic id allocator does not see a cycle that runs through a
//! union. TUPLE never discharges a carried dependence itself; that is
//! RETARGET's job.
