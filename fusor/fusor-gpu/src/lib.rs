//! `fusor-gpu` — the wgpu [`Target`](fusor_ir::target::Target) end to end.

//! Adapter/capability probing against **WebGPU baseline limits** with
//! per-kernel widening, Launch+`SchedPoint` -> `KernelIr` lowering for every Launch
//! node family, `KernelIr` -> naga `Module` emission with **derived** bind
//! groups and a storage `Uniforms` block at binding 0, the pooled allocator
//! with a platform memory ceiling, the plan cache (memory LRU + disk, salted
//! by exe identity and `DeviceFacts` fingerprint *including*
//! `max_compute_workgroup_storage_size`), and an encoder/submission model
//! whose only host syncs are readback, explicit wait and the allocator retry.
