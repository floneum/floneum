//! The const-rank facade's device handle.
//!
//! This `Device` is a backend plus the session and the graph that values
//! built from it live in, so `Tensor::from_slice(device, [n], xs)` needs no
//! graph argument.
//!
//! # The ambient graph
//!
//! Every fusor value is a node in one e-graph, and an op across two graphs is
//! an error. Constructors that take only a `&Device` (or nothing) build into
//! the graph the most recently created device installed. Creating a second
//! device replaces it, so mixing two devices in one process is not supported
//! here.
//!
//! Nodes accumulate in that graph for the process lifetime; nothing here
//! collects them.
