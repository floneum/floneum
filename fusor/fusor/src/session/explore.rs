//! Online tuning from production dispatches: the epsilon explorer.
//!
//! On a deterministic schedule (a per-key resolve counter, never an RNG), one
//! replay-hit resolve in [`EXPLORE_EPSILON`] substitutes a single candidate
//! plan for the incumbent, arms the per-dispatch timestamp path for that one
//! resolve, and files the kernel's GPU span into the tune cache's sliding
//! windows. A candidate displaces the incumbent in the replay memo only when
//! its window minimum beats the incumbent's by [`TUNE_MARGIN`], on at least
//! [`MIN_OBS`] samples.
//!
//! Granularity follows layout. A candidate that leaves every other launch
//! untouched (`plans_align`) is a per-launch swap: its span files under the
//! launch's own signature. A restructuring candidate is timed whole when the
//! plan fits a query set, or at diff granularity ([`Gran::Diff`]): the arm's
//! changed launches are timed together and their sum is judged against the
//! sum of the incumbent's per-launch windows at its changed launches.
//!
//! Every arm is a `verify_plan`-checked plan over members of the same
//! e-classes, so selection is pure performance. A substitution is safe on an
//! impure plan (the decode step's KV append): the arm runs once, instead of
//! the incumbent, so the plan's one write happens exactly once either way.
//!
//! A step builds the one arm it runs and no others: opening a launch's
//! candidate field names its candidates (`launch_variant_labels`); a name
//! becomes a plan in `materialize_arm` for the single label the step selects.
//! A step also times only the launches its comparison reads, unless the arm's
//! granularity is the whole plan.
