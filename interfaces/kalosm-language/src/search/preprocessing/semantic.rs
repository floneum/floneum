/// Semantic chunks try to chunk together sentences with a similar meaning.
///
/// It starts by embedding the text and then merges chunks together with a score that incentivizes:
/// - Small chunks to merge with adjacent chunks. Small chunks often have very little meaning on their own. In "I am doing very well. What about you?", the sentence "What about you?" doesn't mean much on its own, but when you mere it with the previous sentence, it makes more sense.
/// - Similar chunks to merge. If two chunks are very similar, they are more likely to be merged together.
/// - Very large chunks to stay separate. If two chunks are very large, they are more likely to be kept separate. If we just merge anything that is similar, very large chunks tend to form. We want to keep some level of different chunks, so we don't always merge similar large chunks together.
///
/// The goals here are a bit difficult to define.
/// - We want chunks that have enough context to have meaning
/// - We also want to keep those chunks as small as possible while retaining that meaning to make them cheaper to feed to the LLM
/// - Ideally the chunks have unique embeddings so it easier to find them with a query vector
//
/// Potential ways we could improve the quality of the chunks:
/// - Word embeddings for first level pass? The sentence embeddings this implementation uses are very slow for large documents.
/// - Estimating merges by averaging the embeddings of the two chunks? Very similar chunks tend to have an embedding after merging that is very similar to the average of the embeddings of the two chunks (cos similarity of > 0.95)
/// - Find Keywords to detect what chunks refer to similar concepts? It is difficult to tell the meaning of some text that only refers to previous chunks. For example, "This further emphasizes the importance of the previous paragraph." means nothing on its own. It would be nice to know to chunk that with the previous paragraph.
/// - Try to optimize embedding chunks to be as different as possible from each other?
/// - Chunk parentheses, and quotes together? This seems fairly straightforward. Everything inside a short quote or parenthesis is likely to be similar.
